The e-vent.github.io "build" system

### Features ###

The build system scripts can be used to update the nav in all files.

### Description ###

It appends files in this order:
1. _common_header.html
2. <filename>.html
3. _common_footer.html
When it reads those files, it removes the newlines at the end.

Then it replaces these "transforms" with their values:
- $$$BUILDSCRIPT$MY_NAME$$$
- $$$BUILDSCRIPT$TITLE$$$
- $$$BUILDSCRIPT$LINK$<name without .html>$$$
A full list can be found in the source of updatefiles.py. If an unsupported transform is used (note transforms start with "$$$BUILDSCRIPT"), then you will get a warning when building.

### Recommended Usage ###

- Do not touch _content.html if using this method.
1. Edit <name>.html as you normally would.
2. In bash, run python3 ./backport.py
3. In bash, run python3 ./updatefiles.py
4. Check git diff
5.Â Commit
